#  README
This repository is a playground to understand different features of Long-Short Term Memory(LSTM) Networks.
The focus is on the following:
1. Understanding stateful and stateless LSTMs w.r.t accuracy of predictions as a function of length of sequences.
2. Understanding effect of history window and it's length in stateful and stateless LSTMs.
3. Studying effect of data shuffling on the LSTM's prediction accuracy in stateful and stateless LSTMs.
4. Studying effects of different batch sizes with in stateful and stateless LSTMs.
